        <p>The Battle of Settepozzi was fought in 1263 off the Greek island of Spetses between a Genoeseâ€“Byzantine fleet
            and a Venetian fleet (Venetian galley pictured). Genoa had been engaged in the War of Saint Sabas against
            Venice since 1256, and had been allied with the Byzantines since the Treaty of Nymphaeum in 1261. In 1263,
            48 Genoese ships, en route to the Byzantine stronghold of Monemvasia, encountered 32 Venetian ships. A
            Genoese chronicle states that only two of the four admirals of the Genoese fleet and 14 of its ships took
            part in the attack, and were easily routed by the Venetians, who captured four vessels, including both
            flagships, and inflicted considerable casualties. The Venetian victory, and the demonstration of Genoese
            reluctance to confront them, had important political repercussions, as the Byzantines began to distance
            themselves from their alliance with Genoa and restored their relations with Venice, signing a five-year
            non-aggression pact in 1268. (Full article...)</p>
        <p>A good article (GA) is an article that meets a core set of editorial standards, the good article criteria,
            passing through the good article nomination process successfully. They are well-written, contain factually
            accurate and verifiable information, are broad in coverage, neutral in point of view, stable, and
            illustrated, where possible, by relevant images with suitable copyright licenses. Good articles do not have
            to be as comprehensive as featured articles (FA), but they should not omit any major facets of the topic: a
            comparison of the criteria for good and featured articles describes further differences.</p>
        <p>Currently, out of the 6,734,637 articles on Wikipedia, 38,677 are categorized as good articles (about 1 in
            175), most of which are listed below. An additional 6,385 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,060)
            and 4,215 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,600). Because articles are only included in one category, a good
            article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles category. Adding good
            and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 49,277 articles (about 1 in 137). A small plus
            sign inside a circle (This symbol designates good articles on Wikipedia.) in the top-right corner of an
            article's page indicates that the article is good.</p>
        <p>The process for designating an article as a good article is intentionally straightforward. A significant
            contributor to an article may nominate it if they believe it meets the good article criteria. An impartial
            editor may review it from the queue of good article nominations. If it meets the criteria, it is added to
            the list of good articles below. There are instructions for nominators and reviewers. Similarly, anyone who
            believes that an article no longer meets the good article criteria may propose to delist it by following the
            instructions for reassessment.</p>
